White cultivars shows chlorotic and necrotic strips where as red cultivars shows red areas and necrotic strips. On berries we will see superficial spots and later may coalesce making berries appear black. Trunk/arm/cordons shows dark brown black vascular streaking and oozes dark sap when we cut trunk. Some time this measles in associate with numerous secondary wood rotting fungi which decorate the vineyard completely.",
    "Grape___Leaf_blight_(Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot)": "On leaf surface we will see lesions which are irregularly shaped (2 to 25 mm in diameter). Initially lesions are dull red to brown in color turn black later. If disease is severe this lesions may coalesce. On berries we can see symptom similar to black rot but the entire clusters will collapse.",
    "Grape___healthy": HEALTHY_MESSAGE_SYMPTOMS,
    "Orange___Haunglongbing_(Citrus_greening)": "Yellowing of leaf veins and adjacent tissues; blotchy, asymmetrical chlorosis on leaves; leaf drop, twig dieback, stunted growth; fruit remains green, misshapen, and bitter-tasting with aborted seeds; tree may decline and die over several years.",
    "Peach___Bacterial_spot": "Water soaked, angular gray lesions on the underside of the leaves which turn purple and necrotic in the center and cause a shot hole appearance if lesion center drops out; if lesions are present in high numbers on leaves they may become chlorotic and drop from tree; cankers develop on twigs either as raised blisters or as a dark area surrounding a bud that fails to open; in years of severe infection the entire fruit crop may be lost; lesions on fruit begin as small brown, water-soaked lesions which may exude gum",
    "Peach___healthy": HEALTHY_MESSAGE_SYMPTOMS,
    "Pepper,_bell___Bacterial_spot": "Water-soaked lesions that dry out and turn brown forming on the underside of the leaves; raised brown cankers on stems; cracked brown lesions on fruit.",
    "Pepper,_bell___healthy": HEALTHY_MESSAGE_SYMPTOMS,
    "Potato___Early_blight": "Dark brown to black concentric spots ('target spots') on older leaves; surrounding tissue may turn yellow; lesions enlarge and cause leaf drop, reducing photosynthesis and tuber yield; can also affect stems and fruit.",
    "Potato___Late_blight": "Large, irregularly shaped, water-soaked lesions on leaves and stems that quickly turn brown and necrotic; white, fluffy fungal growth may be visible on undersides of leaves in humid conditions; affected tubers develop brown, granular rot.",
    "Potato___healthy": HEALTHY_MESSAGE_SYMPTOMS,
    "Raspberry___healthy": HEALTHY_MESSAGE_SYMPTOMS,
    "Soybean___healthy": HEALTHY_MESSAGE_SYMPTOMS,
    "Squash___Powdery_mildew": "White powdery growth on the upper surfaces of leaves and stems; infected areas stunted and distorted.",
    "Strawberry___Leaf_scorch": "Irregular dark purple or brown blotches on upper leaf surface which may colaesce to produce large purplish brown patches; tissue between blotches may turn purple or red; lesions may also develop on flowers and fruits; affected petals may wither and drop from plant; lesions may girdle peduncles causing death of fruit.",
    "Strawberry___healthy": HEALTHY_MESSAGE_SYMPTOMS,
    "Tomato___Bacterial_spot": "Bacterial spot lesions starts out as small water-soaked spots; lesions become more numerous and coalesce to form necrotic areas on the leaves giving them a blighted appearance; of leaves drop from the plant severe defoliation can occur leaving the fruit susceptible to sunscald; mature spots have a greasy appearance and may appear transparent when held up to light; centers of lesions dry up and fall out of the leaf; blighted leaves often remain attached to the plant and give it a blighted appearance; fruit infections start as a slightly raised blister; lesions may have a faint halo which eventually disappears; lesions on fruit may have a raised margin and sunken center which gives the fruit a scabby appearance.",
    "Tomato___Early_blight": "Dark brown spots with concentric rings (target spots) on older leaves; surrounding yellowing tissue; defoliation begins from the bottom of the plant upwards; lesions may also form on stems and fruit near calyx.",
    "Tomato___Late_blight": "Large, irregular, water-soaked lesions on leaves that rapidly turn brown and necrotic; white fungal growth on undersides of leaves under humid conditions; fruit develops firm, dark brown to black lesions with greasy appearance; rapid plant collapse possible.",
    "Tomato___Leaf_Mold": "The older leaves exhibit pale greenish to yellow spots (without distinguishable margins) on upper surface. Whereas the lower portion of this spots exhibit green to brown velvety fungal growth. As the disease progress the spots may coalesce and appear brown. The infected leaves become wither and die but stay attached to the plant. The fungus also infects flowers and fruits. The affected flowers become black and drop off. The affected fruit intially shows smooth black irregular area on the stem end but later it becomes sunken, leathery and dry.",
    "Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot": "Symptoms may occur at any stage of tomato development and begin as small, water-soaked spots or circular grayish-white spots on the underside of older leaves; spots have a grayish center and a dark margin and they may colasece; fungal fruiting bodies are visible as tiny black specks in the center of spot; spots may also appear on stems, fruit calyxes, and flowers.",
    "Tomato___Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite": "Leaves stippled with yellow; leaves may appear bronzed; webbing covering leaves; mites may be visible as tiny moving dots on the webs or underside of leaves, best viewed using a hand lens; usually not spotted until there are visible symptoms on the plant; leaves turn yellow and may drop from plant.",
    "Tomato___Target_Spot": "The fungus infects all parts of plant. Infected leaves shows small, pinpoint, water soaked spots initially. As the disease progress the spots enlarge to become necrotic lesions with conspicuous concentric circles, dark margins and light brown centers. Whereas the fruits exhibit brown, slightly sunken flecks in the beginning but later the lesions become large pitted appearance.",
    "Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus": "The infected leaves become reduced in size, curl upward, appear crumpled and show yellowing of veins and leaf margins. The internodes become shorter and whole plant appear stunted and bushy. The whole plant stand erect with only upright growth. The flowers may not develop and drop off.",
    "Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus": "Symptoms can occur at any growth stage and any part of the plant can be affected; infected leaves generally exhibit a dark green mottling or mosaic; some strains of the virus can cause yellow mottling on the leaves; young leaves may be stunted or distorted; severely infected leaves may have raised green areas; fruit yields are reduced in infected plants; green fruit may have yellow blotches or necrotic spots; dark necrotic streaks may appear on the stems, petioles leaves and fruit.",
