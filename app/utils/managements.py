    "Apple___Apple_scab": "Rake and remove fallen leaves in autumn to prevent the disease from surviving the winter. You can speed up leaf drop with a mix of fertilizer and zinc, and sprinkle lime over the leaves. In spring, apply natural fungicides like copper soap or Bordeaux mix when new leaves start to grow, especially if rain is expected.",
    "Apple___Black_rot": "Prune and remove dead wood, shriveled fruit, or blackened branches. Burn or discard them away from your garden. Apply a fungicide regularly during the growing season, starting early to stop the spread before it starts.",
